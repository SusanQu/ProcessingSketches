# Processing Sketches
This is a repository for code sketches made in Processing. 

Currently I'm running Processing in Python mode, each folder contains one sketch. In the near future, I might translate them the sketches to p5.js, so it becomes more accessible on the web, without running the Processing Development Environment.
